# Localization

## Editing messages for an existing locale

Existing locale messages can be modified by editing the corresponding file in
the `app/src/script/intl` directory.

To test your changes, rebuild the app:

```shell
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant/app && npm run build-release"
```

then check the result in your local instance by going to
`https://local.cocorico.cc` in your Web browser.

## Adding a new locale

In `provisioning/inventory/group_vars/all.yml`, edit the `supported_locales`
dictionary to add the new locale. Here is an example to add the `es-ES` locale:

```yml
supported_locales:
  fr-FR: Français
  en-US: English
  es-ES: Español
```

Add the corresponding JSON localization file in the `app/src/script/intl`
directory. For example, for the `es-ES` locale, add and fill the
`app/src/script/intl/es-ES.json` file.

Instead of creating that file out of nothing, we recommend to copy an
existing JSON localization file - such as `en-US.json` - and translate its
content.

When you're done filling up the JSON file, provision the machine to
automatically update the locale list and rebuild the app:

```shell
vagrant provision
```

Then check the result in your local instance by going to
`https://local.cocorico.cc` in your Web browser.

## Translating pages

Pages are not stored in the JSON localization message files. They are stored in
the database and must be created/edited through the CMS.

### Editing an existing page

#### With the CMS (recommended)

If the translated page already exists, you can directly edit its content:

* make sure your local instance is running with `vagrant up`
* in your Web browser, go to `https://local.cocorico.cc/admin/pages` and
login if necessary
* open the page you want to edit
* edit the page content
* click on "Save"

You can check the result in your local instance by going to
`https://local.cocorico.cc` in your Web browser.

When you are done editing the translated pages, don't forget to export them from
the database:

```shell
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant/api && ./scripts/save-pages.js"
```

#### Without the CMS (not recommended)

You can directly edit the corresponding exported page HTML/Markdown file. They
are located in the `api/db/pages` directory.

To check the result when you are done editing the translated pages, you must
first import your changes in the CMS:

```shell
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant/api && ./scripts/import-pages.js"
```

then by go to `https://local.cocorico.cc` in your Web browser.

### Creating a new translation for a page

If the translated page does not already exists, you must create it from scratch.
To do so, for each translated page you want to create:

* make sure your local instance is running with `vagrant up`
* in your Web browser, go to `https://local.cocorico.cc/admin/pages?create` and
login if necessary
* fill the text input with the name of your translated page and click "Create"
* configure the newly created page and write its content
* click on "Save"

**Attention!** You have to make sure the slug of your translated page - which is
automatically generated from its title - fits the one specified in the
corresponding JSON localization file (if any). For example, for the "Accueil"
French page, the generated slug is "accueil" and the JSON localization file
contains:

```json
"slug" : {
    "HOME": "accueil"
}
```

You can either change the JSON localization file or the page title to make sure
the slugs match.

If the page you are translating is not listed in the `slug` section of the JSON
localization file, then you don't have to worry about its title/slug.

When all your translated pages are set, don't forget to export them from
the database:

```shell
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant/api && ./scripts/save-pages.js"
```

## Submitting your work

When you're all set and all your pages are exported, you can create a new GIT
branch, add your files to the repository and commit them. Here is an example to
commit and push new pages for the "es-ES" (Spanish) locale:

```shell
git checkout -b localization/es-ES
git add api/db/pages/* app/src/script/intl/*.json
git commit api/db/pages/* app/src/script/intl/*.json
git push origin localization/es-ES
```

Feel free to set the branch name ("localization/es-ES" in the example above) to
better reflect your proposed changes and additions, but try to always:
* prefix it with "localization/";
* indicate the ISO code of the locale you changed.

When your branch has been pushed, go to Github and
[create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
The community will then be able to review it and merge your work.
